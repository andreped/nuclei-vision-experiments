# nuclei-vision-experiments

This is an old project from 2019, which I only uploaded to store it somewhere.

This repository contains experiments on the PanNuke dataset to perform various
computer vision tasks on nuclei in histopathology images.

The tested methods were:
* U-Net for binary and semantic segmentation
* YOLOv1 and YOLOv3 for object detection
* Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation
* Watershed-based algorithm for semantic segmentation
* Morphology-based algorithm for separating semantic segmentation of nuclei into separate instances
* Multi-head U-Net to perform simultaneous image classification and semantic segmentation
